                <h3 class="title">Our Heritage</h3>
                <br>
                <h2>Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Raskbind opened in 2023, and it’s just as true today.</h2>
                <p>
                   <br>
                    Back then, the company was a single site in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Raskbind offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Starbucks, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2022, Rahul Sharma, the founder and CEO of an Indian company.Rahul was drawn into Raskbind and joined a year later. Rahul Sharma is highly passionate about our work, and he played a pivotal role in inventing Raskbind.

                    <br>
                    A year later, in 2023, Rahul Sharma travelled to Italy and became captivated by Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition to India
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the beginning, Raskbind set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
