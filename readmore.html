                        Meet Altamash Mahmood
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm Altamash Mahmood, the founder and lead video editor at AM Frame Works. My journey into the world of video editing began with a simple curiosity about storytelling through visuals. This curiosity quickly turned into a passion, and for the past five years, I've dedicated myself to mastering the art and craft of video editing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My Journey
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After completing my 12th grade, I dove headfirst into the dynamic field of video production. From early freelance projects to working with some of the most influential content creators, my career has been a blend of continuous learning and creative exploration. One of my most notable collaborations is with "Dear Sir," a YouTube channel that boasts over 18 million subscribers. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of engaging storytelling.
